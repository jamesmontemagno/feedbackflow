# FeedbackFlow

## Overview

FeedbackFlow is a comprehensive feedback collection and analysis platform that helps teams gather, consolidate, and analyze feedback from multiple sources including GitHub, YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News, and social media platforms. The platform consists of a modern Blazor web application, Azure Functions backend, and command-line tools for data collection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use FeedbackFlow, ensure you have the following:

- .NET 9.0 SDK installed
- A valid GitHub API Key
- A valid YouTube API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/feedbackflow.git
   cd feedbackflow
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Running the Application

The easiest way to run FeedbackFlow is using .NET Aspire, which orchestrates both the web application and Azure Functions:

1. Navigate to the AppHost directory:
   ```bash
   cd FeedbackFlow.AppHost
   ```

2. Run the orchestrated application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

This will start both the web application and Azure Functions locally with proper service discovery and monitoring. You will be prompted to enter API keys for the Azure Function to you on startup for the first time or you can enter them later on the ... menu.

### Command-Line Tools Usage

#### GitHub Feedback Collector (`ghdump`)

```bash
cd ghdump
dotnet run -- -r <owner/repository>
```

Example:
```bash
dotnet run -- -r microsoft/dotnet
```

#### YouTube Comment Collector (`ytdump`)

```bash
cd ytdump
dotnet run -- -v <video-id> -o <output-file.json>
```

Example:
```bash
dotnet run -- -v dQw4w9WgXcQ -o youtube-comments.json
```

#### Reddit Collector (`rddump`)

```bash
cd rddump
dotnet run -- -u <reddit-url>
```

#### Hacker News Collector (`hndump`)

```bash
cd hndump
dotnet run -- -i <story-id>
```

### Coding Standards

- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public, camelCase for private)
- Use file-scoped namespaces
- Implement proper async/await patterns
- Add component-specific CSS in `.razor.css` files for Blazor components
- Support both light and dark themes
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Deployment

### Azure Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Azure with:

- **Azure App Service** for the web application
- **Azure Functions** for the serverless backend
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD with staging and production environments

### Environment Configuration

Set up the following environments:
- **Production**: `https://feedbackflow.app`
- **Staging**: `https://staging.feedbackflow.app` (deployed on PR creation)

## API Keys and Configuration

FeedbackFlow can run in **mock mode** for testing without requiring API keys. When running in debug mode without configured keys, the application will automatically use mock data.

### Mock Mode (No Keys Required)
- **Hacker News**: Works without keys in all modes
- **Dev Blogs**: Works without keys in all modes  
- **Other Sources**: Use mock data when keys are not configured in debug mode

### Production API Keys (Optional for Testing)

If you want to test with real data, configure the following keys in your `local.settings.json` or ideally User Secrets:

#### Required for Real Data Collection:
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: For GitHub issues, discussions, and pull requests
- **YouTube API Key**: For YouTube video comments
- **Azure OpenAI**: For AI-powered sentiment analysis and insights

#### Optional:
- **Reddit Client ID/Secret**: For Reddit posts and comments
- **Twitter Bearer Token**: For Twitter/X data collection
- **BlueSky Credentials**: For BlueSky social media integration

### Configuration File

Create `feedbackfunctions/local.settings.json` or just the values in user secretes for production keys:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType": "files",
    "YouTube:ApiKey": "",
    "Reddit:ClientId": "",
    "Reddit:ClientSecret": "",
    "GitHub:AccessToken": "",
    "Azure:OpenAI:Endpoint": "",
    "Azure:OpenAI:ApiKey": "",
    "Azure:OpenAI:Deployment": "",
    "Twitter:BearerToken": "",
    "BlueSky:Username": "",
    "BlueSky:AppPassword": "",
    "Mastodon:AccessToken": "",
    "Mastodon:ClientKey": "",
    "Mastodon:ClientSecret": "",
    "UseMocks": false
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Without this configuration file, the application will run in mock mode, which is perfect for testing and development.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not check these into source control!
