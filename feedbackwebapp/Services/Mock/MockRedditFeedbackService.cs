## Overall Sentiment & Engagement
ðŸŽ¯ Active technical discussion with high-quality responses ({totalComments} total comments)
ðŸ“Š Main post has moderate engagement (67% upvote ratio)
ðŸ’¬ Key responses highly upvoted (98 and 32 points)

## Key Technical Points
1. Performance issues between ASP.NET and .NET Core applications
2. Importance of proper profiling and analysis
3. Discussion of thread pool management in ASP.NET Core

## Recommendations
1. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
2. Check for blocking I/O operations
3. Review thread pool configuration
4. Consider async/await implementation

## Community Interaction
- High engagement from {totalComments} developers
- Constructive discussion format
- Good follow-up questions from OP

## Action Items
1. Implement profiling
2. Review async operations
3. Analyze thread pool usage";
